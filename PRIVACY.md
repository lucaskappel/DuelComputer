# DuelComputer Privacy Policy
DuelComputer tracks and saves certain data about servers, users, and messages which are important for proper functionality.

The data about servers DuelComptuer saves is regarding marking certain channels for the bot's functionality. DuelComputer saves the id's of channels and marks them as channels allowed for use of "moderation", "rulings", or "bot".

DuelComputer is allowed message intent for the purpose of allowing users to set these channels via text commands.

DuelComputer is also allowed message intent for the purpose of human-like interactions, such as reciprocating greetings, and replying to insults directed at it.


DuelComputer also (will, in the future) save the user ID of any user who uses its features. This is for purposes of preventing spam. 
If a user attempts to use DuelComptuer too often within a 1-minute period, DuelComputer will save their ID into a blacklist which prevents the user from using DuelComputer's features. 
After a certain time frame, that user's ID will then be removed from the cache from which it saves the ID.
